# ITASORL recorded runs

End-to-end runs via `python scripts/run_e2e.py` write a dated folder under `fullruns/`:

```
fullruns/MMDDYYYY/
  SUMMARY.md       ← start here (plain-English outcome)
  manifest.json    ← step status, timings, artifact paths
  status.json      ← live step + last line (updated during run)
  combined.log     ← full stdout (updated live during run)
  bundle.zip       ← download this to keep everything
  steps/
    pytest.log
    expB_full.log
    expB_full.json   ← parsed metrics per step
    ...
  artifacts/
    docs/figures/...  ← copied PNGs
    expB2_results.json
    expB2_survival.png
```

**Latest run path** is also written to `results/LATEST_RUN.txt`.

**Canonical B-v2 metrics** (full scale, 300 updates, 3 seeds) live in
`artifacts/expB2/expB2_results.json`, promoted from `fullruns/06302026` (Colab,
2026-06-30). Narrative and comparison vs the initial lab run: `docs/FINDINGS.md` §9.
The prior lab confirmatory JSON is archived as `expB2_results_confirmatory_n3.json`.

**Watch a run in progress** (second terminal):

```bash
python scripts/watch_run.py --follow
```

On Google Colab (see `notebooks/colab_gpu.ipynb`, playbook `ralph/COLAB.md`):

- Set **`RUN_PROFILE`** in the config cell (`quick`, `full`, `b2_seed0`, `b2_only`, `experiments_no_b2`).
- Runs use **local disk** (`fullruns/` under the repo). Do not set `--results-dir` to Drive (FUSE I/O is slow and often fails).
- `ITASORL_DRIVE_SYNC` mirrors `combined.log`, `status.json`, `manifest.json`, and per-step outputs to Drive after each step.
- If Colab disconnects, set `RESUME_RUN_DIR` in the notebook to the mirrored Drive folder and run with `--resume` (the notebook copies Drive to local first).
- After the run: `python scripts/compare_expB2_artifacts.py --run fullruns/MMDDYYYY` (also in the notebook summary cell).
