# Experiment status (living snapshot)

Ralph reads this **every run** before choosing work. Update it when new
`fullruns/` appear, canonical artifacts change, or conclusions shift.

Last updated: **2026-07-07** (post B-v3 regime n=10 power extension)

## Core claim (unchanged)

**Detectable ≠ learned.** Outside oracles read L2 drift trivially (~0.99 AUROC).
Organisms trained only on prediction stay at chance for world identity (~0.51).
Survival pressure (B-v2) does **not** reach the pre-registered encoding bar (0.65).
The identifiable, policy-relevant B-v3 regime (per-episode constant drag) lifts the
survival probe to 0.610 at n=10, still below 0.65.

## Latest end-to-end runs

| Run folder | Mode | Commit | GPU | Duration | B-v2 survival @ drift 0.45 |
|------------|------|--------|-----|----------|----------------------------|
| `fullruns/06292026` | quick (60 upd, 2 seeds) | `fbae1e5` | L4 | 22 min | **0.473** |
| `fullruns/06302026` | full (300 upd, 3 seeds) | `4c16be6` | T4 | 238 min | **0.523 ± 0.045** |
| `fullruns/07062026` | full (300 upd, 10 seeds, regime B-v3) | `820849f` | RTX 4050 | 337 min | **0.610 +/- 0.047** |

Exp A and Exp B metrics are **byte-identical** between quick and full runs.
Long runtime changed B-v2 numerics modestly (+0.05) but **not the verdict**.

Per-seed survival @ drift 0.45 (06302026): **0.586, 0.495, 0.488** (high variance).

Pre-registered verdict (06302026): **H_B2 NOT met** — strengthened negative.
Manipulation check passed. Drag ceiling ≈ 0.75 vs identity target ≈ 0.52.

Per-seed survival @ drift 0.45 (07062026, B-v3 regime, n=10): **0.669, 0.514, 0.594,
0.642, 0.611, 0.586, 0.615, 0.638, 0.558, 0.677** (2/10 cross 0.65).

Pre-registered verdict (07062026, B-v3 regime): **H_B3 NOT met** (intermediate zone).
Survival 0.610 (90% CI [0.585, 0.634]) beats untrained 0.500 and predictor 0.513 by
>0.05 but misses the 0.65 SESOI; the n=10 CI excludes 0.65, so the adjudication is
decisive. Volatility readout (target_var 0.535, target_full 0.611) also below 0.65. L0
control equivalent to chance; manipulation check passed. Dissociation: identity target
0.610 > momentary drag-tracking ceiling 0.487 (not merely reactive drag-tracking).
Next per PREREG_Bv3 sec.10: report the sysid-aux capacity ceiling (profile `bv3_ceiling`).

## Canonical published artifacts

| Artifact | Provenance |
|----------|------------|
| `artifacts/expB2/expB2_results.json` | Promoted from `fullruns/06302026` (2026-07-01) |
| `artifacts/expB2/expB2_results_confirmatory_n3.json` | Initial lab run (survival @ 0.45 ≈ **0.595**) |

**Discrepancy:** independent Colab replication (0.523) does **not** reproduce the
initial lab mean (0.595). Same config (300 updates, 3 seeds); likely mix of code
version (rigor-hardening PR #8), GPU variance, and seed noise. Scientific
conclusion is the same (below 0.65); effect size in FINDINGS §9 is now split
into initial vs replication tables.

**B-v3 candidate:** `fullruns/07062026` (n=10 regime, 0.610) is the candidate canonical
B-v3 artifact; not yet promoted (flag for human decision before moving files).

Narrative: `docs/FINDINGS.md` §7 (next steps), §9 (B-v2).

## Open scientific questions

1. **Replication gap:** Why do seeds 1–2 land ~0.49 while seed 0 ~0.586? Code,
   GPU, or true variance? Local seed-0 diagnostic deferred (needs human to start).
2. **Power:** RESOLVED (07062026): the n=10 regime extension ran (RTX 4050, 337 min);
   survival 0.610 +/- 0.047, 90% CI [0.585, 0.634] excludes 0.65, and L0 TOST/ROPE pass
   at n=10 (equivalent to chance).
3. **Reactive vs representational:** Agent may exploit felt drag without encoding
   persistent world identity; held-out / common-garden probe not yet implemented.
   (07062026: identity target 0.610 > drag-tracking ceiling 0.487 is suggestive of a
   persistent signal, but the held-out probe remains the clean test.)
4. **L3 artifact:** Generative fingerprint (§7.3) not built; highest-interest
   direction if L2 null holds under scale.

## Infrastructure notes

- Colab full runs: use `notebooks/colab_gpu.ipynb` with **`RUN_PROFILE`**
  (see `ralph/COLAB.md`). Local disk + Drive mirror; `--resume` for timeouts.
- Ralph must **not** start multi-hour GPU sweeps without explicit human approval.
  Prepare scripts, tests, and docs instead; log the run plan under BACKLOG Questions.

## How to refresh this file

After a new `fullruns/MMDDYYYY/` completes:

1. Read `SUMMARY.md`, `steps/expB2.json`, `steps/expB2.log` (verdict line).
2. Compare primary endpoint to rows above.
3. Update the table and "Last updated" date.
4. Note whether canonical artifacts should be re-promoted.
