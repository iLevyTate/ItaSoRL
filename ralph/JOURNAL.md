## 2026-06-27 — open-loop rollout API (run_expB_gap / run_expB_kstep crashes)
- Found: `run_expB_gap.py` and `run_expB_kstep.py` (both documented runnable in
  README.md:93 and FINDINGS.md §3.3/§3.4/§8) crash immediately —
  `train_world_model()` had no `rollout_context`/`delta` params and
  `RecurrentWorldModel` had no `forward_rollout`. Reproduced with a direct call
  (`TypeError: unexpected keyword argument 'rollout_context'`).
- Fix:   added `RecurrentWorldModel.forward_rollout` (teacher-force `context`
  steps, then imagine open-loop feeding own predictions back) + `rollout_loss`,
  and a `self.delta` output-convention flag (absolute vs observation-change);
  wired `rollout_context`/`delta` kwargs into `train_world_model`. Default path
  (rollout_context=None) is unchanged.
- Verify: `python run_expB_gap.py` -> open-loop MSE 0.666 < mean 0.889 <
  persistence 1.348 (ENGAGED; baselines match FINDINGS to 3 dp), delta engagement
  1.07x/1.06x (matches FINDINGS "1.07x"), target AUROC at chance.
  `python run_expB_kstep.py` -> no liftoff, target 0.506/0.481/0.482 across
  horizons (FINDINGS 0.516/0.523/0.490). Both exit 0. `experiment_b.py` smoke and
  AST syntax check still pass (no regression to the default-signature callers).
- Commit: 796c9b0.

## 2026-06-27 — CI ruff gate: fix real (F) issues, defer style policy
- Found: CI's `python` job (ci.yml) runs `ruff check .` + `ruff format --check .`
  but there is no ruff config, so it lints with defaults and is RED — 57 errors.
  Breakdown: 46 E702 (semicolons) + 5 E401 (multi-import) + 1 E701 + 1 E731 +
  1 E741 (all deliberate compact style) and 3 genuine issues: 2 F401 unused
  `numpy` imports (run_expA.py, run_expA_l2.py) + 1 F541 empty f-string
  (run_expA.py).
- Fix:   auto-fixed only the 3 F-code issues (`ruff check --select F401,F541
  --fix`); `ruff check --select F` is now clean. Did NOT touch the 53 stylistic
  errors: reformatting 14 files or relaxing the CI gate is a style-policy call,
  recorded under BACKLOG "Questions / needs a human" with both options.
- Verify: `python -m py_compile run_expA.py run_expA_l2.py` OK; diff shows only
  the dead import lines + the f-string prefix changed (runtime unchanged).
- Commit: d1184af.

## 2026-06-27 — green the ruff CI gate (style-preserving, human-approved)
- Found: CI `python` job red at the ruff step (53 remaining stylistic errors);
  resolving it was a style-policy decision. Human chose option A (keep the
  compact style, configure the tool).
- Fix:   added `ruff.toml` ignoring the stylistic E rules (E401/E701/E702/E731/
  E741) while keeping all F + E9 bug-catchers; removed the `ruff format --check`
  step from ci.yml (the formatter cannot preserve the one-line style). Put the
  config in ruff.toml, NOT pyproject.toml, to avoid tripping CI's `pip install
  -e .` and release.yml's `python -m build` (no packaging metadata exists).
- Verify: `python -m ruff check .` -> "All checks passed!".
- Commit: 1b1b39b.

## 2026-06-27 — add requirements.txt + re-enable pip cache
- Found: no dependency manifest; CI's install step was stubbed (`if [ -f
  requirements.txt ]`) and the pip cache was disabled with a note to re-enable
  once a manifest existed.
- Fix:   added requirements.txt (numpy>=1.24, scikit-learn>=1.3, matplotlib>=3.7,
  torch>=2.0; bounds loose for the 3.10-3.12 matrix) and set `cache: pip` +
  `cache-dependency-path: requirements.txt` in ci.yml.
- Verify: parsed every requirement with packaging.Requirement and confirmed the
  installed versions (numpy 1.26.4 / sklearn 1.5.2 / matplotlib 3.9.4 / torch
  2.7.0) satisfy the bounds -> ALL OK.
- Commit: 0da972d.

## 2026-06-27 — add the first regression test suite
- Found: no tests existed; CI's pytest step skipped itself, and the keystone
  invariants (matched-pair L0 identity, exact snapshot/restore, the new rollout
  API) had no guard.
- Fix:   added pytest.ini (pythonpath=., testpaths=tests) and tests/ with 10
  tests - obs-format contract, get/set_state exact roundtrip, matched-pair L0
  bit-identity, L1 quantization-only divergence, and the open-loop rollout
  (teacher-forced prefix == forward, full context == forward, finite loss in
  both modes, open-loop ignores future obs).
- Verify: `python -m pytest -q` -> 10 passed in ~2.6s; `python -m ruff check .`
  -> All checks passed.
- Commit: 9cc085c.

## 2026-06-27 — deep correctness pass (world dynamics + oracles)
- Found: NO new bug. Reviewed terrain gradient + slope/gravity coupling, drag
  AR(1) stability, thermoregulation bounds, the L1 and L2 oracle math, and RNG
  determinism in get_state/set_state. One suspicion - L1Discretize emitting
  float64 and breaking the float32 obs contract - was DISPROVEN empirically:
  numpy treats the Python-float delta as a weak scalar, so float32/float stays
  float32 (holds under numpy 1.x value-based casting and 2.0 NEP 50).
- Evidence: snapshot/restore is bit-exact even under an obs-dependent policy over
  60 steps (max diff 0.0); run_expA.py validates L0 oracle 0.509 (chance), L1
  @delta=0.06 AUROC 1.000, ceiling falls to chance as delta->sigma, leakage gate
  PASS clean / FAIL on contamination.
- Fix:   converted the verified invariants into 5 regression tests (reactive-
  policy L0 identity, L1 obs-format/dtype identity, Experiment A oracle + leakage
  gate). These cover gaps the prior const-policy tests missed.
- Verify: `python -m pytest -q` -> 15 passed (~12s); `python -m ruff check .`
  -> All checks passed.
- Commit: cf33f64.

## 2026-06-27 — hunt: logschema Parquet writer + run scripts (no bug)
- Found: NO bug. Suspected StepWriter._flush would crash because pa.array infers
  float64/int64/list<double> that mismatch the float32/int32/list<float32>
  schema - DISPROVEN: pyarrow's record_batch(arrays, schema=...) casts them.
  Verified empty default lists, multi-batch buffering, activation schema, and
  manifest JSON round-trip all work. Ran the 3 remaining run scripts
  (full/surprise/nonlinear): all exit 0 and reproduce FINDINGS qualitatively, so
  all 7 run scripts now execute end-to-end.
- Fix:   added tests/test_logschema.py (4 tests: StepWriter row/type round-trip,
  incomplete-record rejection, manifest round-trip, record template coverage).
  Recorded the run-scripts no-main-guard footgun as a deferred P3 (churn for no
  current bug).
- Verify: `python -m pytest -q` -> 19 passed; `python -m ruff check .` -> All
  checks passed.
- Commit: this run.

## 2026-06-28 — compute_gae mask leakage (real correctness bug, A2C advantages)
- Found: top open backlog item asked to test `experiment_b2.compute_gae` and hunt
  for mask leakage. Found a REAL bug, not just a gap. The GAE accumulator gated
  its carry with the CURRENT step's mask (`gae = delta + gamma*lam*m*gae`). The
  correct GAE recursion needs the NEXT step's mask there (reset the carry across
  the episode boundary). For any episode shorter than Tmax, the loop visits the
  padded steps first (m=0, so `gae` becomes that step's delta = -V(pad)), then at
  the last valid step (m=1) multiplies that garbage in: the last in-episode
  advantage (and value target) gained a spurious `-gamma*lam*V(pad)` term.
  Full-length episodes (no padding) were correct, which hid the bug. Under the
  harsh B-v2 metabolism most episodes die early, so most episodes were affected.
- Reproduced: oracle test vs an independent textbook per-episode GAE on a 2-episode
  batch (ep0 len 2 padded to Tmax 3 with value[0,2]=0.7). Buggy last-step adv =
  1.0417 (terminated) / 1.3386 (truncated) vs oracle 1.7 / 1.997 - exactly the
  predicted -gamma*lam*0.7 leak.
- Fix: carry `next_mask` (mask of t+1, init 0) and gate the accumulator with it;
  dropped the now-redundant `nonterm` factor on the bootstrap in `delta` (next_v
  already stays at `boot` across padding, so the bootstrap was already correct and
  is unchanged). Shapes / return signature / truncation semantics all preserved.
- Verify: `python -m pytest -q` -> 33 passed (2 new compute_gae oracle tests RED
  before, GREEN after); `python -m ruff check .` -> All checks passed;
  `python experiment_b2.py` smoke runs end-to-end on CUDA, exit 0.
- Commit: this run.
