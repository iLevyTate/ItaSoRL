# Ralph Backlog

Living list of bugs, gaps, and issues. The loop reads this first and works the
highest-priority **Open** item each run. Keep entries one line where possible:
`SEV | file:line | description`.

Severity: **P0** crash/build-break · **P1** correctness/security · **P2** missing
test/contract gap · **P3** footgun/cleanup.

## Open
<!-- Ralph adds discovered issues here, highest severity first. -->
P2 | repo root | No `requirements.txt` (CI's install + pip-cache steps are stubbed waiting for one). Deps per FINDINGS §8: numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, torch. Now unblocked (ruff gate green).
P2 | repo root | No test suite (CI's pytest step skips itself). Add a real regression test - e.g. matched-pair L0 bit-identity + the open-loop rollout fix. Now unblocked.

## In progress
<!-- The item currently being worked, if any. -->

## Done
<!-- Resolved items, newest first. Include the fixing commit's short SHA. -->
P1 | ruff.toml + .github/workflows/ci.yml | CI `python` job was RED: ruff lints with defaults but the repo uses a deliberate compact style (semicolons, multi-import lines). Decision (human-approved: keep style): added ruff.toml ignoring the stylistic E rules (E401/E701/E702/E731/E741) while keeping all F/E9 bug-catchers, and dropped the `ruff format --check` step (formatter can't preserve the style). `ruff check .` now passes. Fixed 2026-06-27.
P3 | run_expA.py, run_expA_l2.py | Dead code flagged by CI's ruff gate: 2 unused `numpy` imports (F401) + 1 placeholder-less f-string (F541). Auto-fixed; `ruff check --select F` now clean. Fixed 2026-06-27.
P0 | experiment_b.py + agent.py | `run_expB_gap.py` & `run_expB_kstep.py` crashed (missing `train_world_model(rollout_context=, delta=)` and `RecurrentWorldModel.forward_rollout`). Implemented the open-loop rollout API; both scripts now run and reproduce FINDINGS.md (gap: engaged, delta 1.07x; kstep: no liftoff). Fixed 2026-06-27.
