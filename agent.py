"""
ITASORL - Experiment B, the agent: a compact recurrent world model (RSSM-lite).

The agent is trained ONLY to predict its own sensory stream (next-step
prediction). It is never told which world it inhabits and never rewarded for
world identity. The recurrent state h_t is the object Experiment B probes: if
world identity is linearly decodable from h_t, and that decoding is selective
(beats a randomized-label control), the agent has encoded it incidentally - the
core H4 claim ("readout, not reward").

A full Dreamer-style agent adds an actor-critic trained on survival reward; this
self-supervised world model is the natural first rung and isolates the probe
pipeline. The actor-critic swaps in later WITHOUT changing the probe harness,
because the harness only consumes recurrent states.

Two backends are provided so the pipeline always runs:
  - RecurrentWorldModel (PyTorch): the real, trainable agent.
  - Reservoir (numpy): an untrained random recurrent embedding. Probing it tests
    whether identity is *present* in a generic recurrent code (an Experiment-A
    adjacent check), and serves as a fallback when torch is unavailable. It does
    NOT support the "the agent learned to encode it" claim - only training does.
