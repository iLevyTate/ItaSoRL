# ITASORL: Findings to Date

*Empirical results from the first build-and-test cycle. This document records what
was run and what was found; the research plan lives in `ITASORL.md` and the world
in `ITASORL_world_spec.md`.*

## TL;DR

We built a tabula-rasa digital world with a controllable "surrogate ladder" and
asked whether a from-scratch agent can tell that its world is a generative
surrogate rather than the authentic base dynamics, using only substrate seams,
with detection **read out, not rewarded**.

**The headline result is a well-controlled negative: detectability does not imply
incidental encoding.** A substrate artifact that an external, privileged oracle
detects almost perfectly (AUROC ≈ 0.99) leaves essentially no decodable trace in a
from-scratch agent's learned representation (AUROC ≈ 0.5), across three different
readout channels, and surviving checks that the training objective was genuinely
engaged and that the probe was not merely too weak (linear *or* nonlinear). The gap
between the *detectability ceiling* (Experiment A) and the *incidental-detection
floor* (Experiment B) is itself the finding, and it reframes the project's core
hypothesis into a falsifiable, conditional question: *under what conditions does
incidental encoding emerge?*

---

## 1. What was tested

The design rests on three invariants: **tabula rasa** (no imported semantics),
**readout-not-reward** (world identity is probed, never trained or rewarded), and
**substrate-grounded** (the only tells are artifacts of the computational
substrate). Detection is measured against a **surrogate ladder**:

| Rung | Nature of the artifact | Status |
|------|------------------------|--------|
| L0 | Identical re-implementation (control, must be at chance) | tested |
| L1 | Observation discretization (a lattice / quantization tell) | tested |
| L2 | Rollout drift (a slowly drifting dynamics coefficient) | tested |
| L3 | Learned world-model surrogate (a generative fingerprint) | not started |
| L4 | Adversarially-hardened surrogate | not started |

Three experiments were planned. This cycle completed Experiment A for L1 and L2,
and the first full arc of Experiment B. Experiment C (emergence under selection)
is not started.

The world is **"A Patch of Earth" v0**, a 2.5D, deterministic, dissipative,
Earth-*like* (authored, not data-driven) environment with a ~146-dimensional
observation (vision raycasts + interoception; smell masked in the first config).

---

## 2. Experiment A: the detectability ceiling (agent-free)

**Method.** An external discriminator on full trajectory logs, run *before* any
agent exists, to (a) measure how detectable each rung is and (b) prove the signal
is not riding on a confound. Trajectories are generated in **matched pairs** (a
shared prefix is snapshotted, then continued once authentically and once through
the surrogate from byte-identical state), so authentic and surrogate differ only
by the artifact. The **unit of inference is the pair**, never the timestep
(grouped cross-validation). A **leakage-audit battery** trains the same
classifier on nuisance channels (reward, episode length, metadata); these *must*
stay at chance, or the result is contaminated.

### 2.1 L1: observation discretization

The detector uses the per-dimension residual against the candidate grid; with a
realistic sensor-noise floor (σ = 0.01) the tell is meaningful rather than a
trivial exact-grid giveaway.

- **Control (L0, identical):** oracle AUROC **0.523** (chance); leakage all 0.500 → **PASS**.
- **L1 (grid Δ = 0.06):** oracle AUROC **1.000**; leakage all 0.500 → **PASS**. The signal is entirely in the substrate observation; nothing leaks.
- **Contamination test:** injecting a +0.02 reward offset into the surrogate drives the reward-leakage baseline to **0.982** → gate **FAILS**, as it should. The audit has teeth.
- **Difficulty calibration:** detection is saturated while the grid is coarser than ≈ 3σ and collapses to chance by ≈ 2σ, exactly the expectation that a grid finer than the noise is invisible.

### 2.2 L2: rollout drift

L2 alters the *dynamics* (the drag coefficient follows a slow AR(1) random walk),
so detection is invariant-based: the oracle re-applies the exact authentic
one-step motion law to the (noisy) logged velocity and measures the residual. A
tamed config (high uniform drag, gravity off, straight-line motion, central
start) isolates the drift signal; measurement noise (σ = 2×10⁻⁴) provides the
floor.

- **Control (drift = 0, identical dynamics):** oracle AUROC **0.440** (chance); leakage all 0.500 → **PASS**.
- **L2 (drift_sigma = 0.30):** oracle AUROC **0.993**; leakage ≈ 0.5 → **PASS**.
- **Contamination test:** reward-leakage rises to **1.000** → gate **FAILS** correctly.
- **Difficulty calibration:** 0.00 → 0.44, 0.01 → 0.71, 0.02 → 0.88, 0.05 → 0.99, plateau ≈ 0.99. Drift is detectable from ≈ 0.02 and saturates by ≈ 0.05.

![Experiment A, L2 detectability ceiling](figures/expA_L2_ceiling.png)

**Methodological note.** For dynamics-altering rungs like L2, reward can be a
*legitimate downstream* consequence of the artifact (different dynamics → different
foraging), so reward is not a clean nuisance channel in general. In the tamed
no-foraging config used here it stayed at chance, but for a foraging agent the
leakage audit must be read with this in mind.

---

## 3. Experiment B: incidental detection (the headline)

**The apparatus.** A compact recurrent world model (RSSM-lite: encoder → GRU →
next-observation decoder) trained **only** to predict its own sensory stream. It
is never told which world it inhabits and never rewarded for world identity. Its
recurrent state `h_t` is the object we probe. A full Dreamer-style agent would add
a survival-trained actor-critic; this self-supervised world model is the natural
first rung and isolates the probe pipeline, which accepts the actor-critic
unchanged.

Each run uses three probes, with the **episode** as the unit of inference:

- **target**: decode world identity from `h_t` (the H4 claim);
- **shuffled**: decode a randomized world label (negative control);
- **speed**: decode above/below-median speed (positive control: states *are* probeable).

The artifact is L2 drift (not L1), deliberately: a probe reading identity from a
dynamics artifact cannot be dismissed as "it is just detecting that the inputs are
quantized."

### 3.1 Recurrent-state probe (one-step world model)

| drift_sigma | target | shuffled | speed (+ctrl) |
|-------------|--------|----------|---------------|
| 0.00 (control) | 0.460 ± 0.021 | 0.510 ± 0.113 | 0.913 ± 0.023 |
| 0.20 | 0.509 ± 0.028 | 0.522 ± 0.069 | 0.898 ± 0.021 |
| 0.45 | 0.510 ± 0.039 | 0.548 ± 0.059 | 0.902 ± 0.008 |

The target sits at chance even at strong drift, while the positive control reads
speed at ≈ 0.90 and the drift = 0 control is clean. The apparatus works; the agent
simply did not encode world identity.

![Experiment B, recurrent-state probe across the drift sweep: the world-identity target stays at chance while the speed positive control stays high](figures/expB_incidental.png)

### 3.2 Prediction-error (surprise) channel

A world model trained on **authentic episodes only** should be measurably
surprised when the dynamics drift. We probe authentic-vs-surrogate from the
agent's per-episode prediction error.

| drift_sigma | surprise-probe AUROC |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 0.00 (control) | 0.511 ± 0.008 |
| 0.20 | 0.444 ± 0.012 |
| 0.45 | 0.596 ± 0.007 |

A faint, *reliable* signal at the strongest drift (0.596, tight error bars), but
nowhere near the oracle's 0.99.

![Experiment B, two incidental-detection channels](figures/expB_channels.png)

### 3.3 Longer-horizon (open-loop k-step) objective

To test whether the null is caused by the *locality* of one-step prediction, the
world model was retrained to imagine forward open-loop: after a context window it
must predict future observations from its recurrent state on actions alone (no new
observations). If locality were the cause, the target should lift as the horizon
grows.

| open-loop horizon | target (drift 0.45) | target (control) |
|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 0 (pure next-step) | 0.516 ± 0.025 | 0.465 ± 0.020 |
| 8 | 0.523 ± 0.028 | 0.444 ± 0.024 |
| 16 | 0.490 ± 0.008 | 0.468 ± 0.035 |

No liftoff. The target stays at chance across all horizons; the control stays
flat.

![Experiment B, does a longer-horizon objective induce encoding?](figures/expB_kstep.png)

### 3.4 The null is robust (engagement and probe checks)

Two checks confirm the negative result is not an artifact of a weak objective or a
weak probe.

**The open-loop objective genuinely engaged.** The absolute-observation rollout
model (horizon 16) reaches an open-loop prediction MSE of **0.52**, well below both
a mean-predictor baseline (0.89) and a persistence baseline (1.35); it really does
predict the imagined future, yet its recurrent state still does not encode world
identity. (A delta-prediction variant, which predicts the observation *change*
where the drag drift most directly lives, only marginally beat its own baseline,
1.07×, and also showed nothing; it is the less informative of the two, precisely
because it under-engaged.)

**A nonlinear probe finds nothing either.** Replacing the linear probe with a
random forest on the same recurrent states leaves the target at chance
(**0.459 ± 0.009** control and **0.482 ± 0.031** drift 0.45), while the positive
control (speed) stays high at ≈ 0.87 to 0.89. World identity is encoded neither
linearly nor nonlinearly, even though speed plainly is.

The null therefore holds across objective horizon, objective engagement, and probe
nonlinearity.

---

## 4. The headline finding

**Detectability ≫ incidental encoding.** Across three independent readout channels
(the recurrent state of a one-step world model, the agent's prediction error, and
the recurrent state of a deep open-loop world model), a from-scratch agent's
representation of an L2 drift artifact is at or near chance (0.49 to 0.60), while a
privileged external oracle detects the identical artifact at ≈ 0.99.

Three things explain the gap:

1. **The oracle is privileged.** It applies the *exact* authentic motion law to
   the *true* velocity and measures the deviation directly. The agent sees
   raycasts, not velocity, and must *learn* an approximate dynamics law that
   simply adapts to whatever it is fed.
2. **The objective is local / under-constraining.** One-step prediction never
   requires representing whether drag is slowly drifting; the next observation is
   predictable either way. The drift's signature lives in long-horizon coherence,
   which self-supervised prediction does not force into the representation. And,
   empirically, even a *verified-engaged* open-loop objective did not change this
   (§3.4).
3. **Readout-not-reward bites.** What no objective requires, the agent does not
   represent. This is the cleanest possible demonstration of the principle.

---

## 5. Validity and caveats

**The apparatus is sound.** The positive control reads speed at ≈ 0.90, and the
drift = 0 control is always at chance, so the null is not an artifact of broken
machinery: two independent sets of authentic episodes are correctly
indistinguishable.

**Caveats, stated plainly:**

- These are modest-scale runs (≈ 110 episodes/class, a few seeds, ≤ 20 epochs,
  hidden = 96). The *magnitudes* could shift with more data, capacity, or
  training, though the qualitative gap is large.
- Two caveats from the first pass have since been **checked and closed** (§3.4):
  the open-loop objective was verified to engage (it beats mean and persistence
  baselines), and a nonlinear probe also finds world identity at chance while
  still reading the positive control. The null is robust to objective horizon,
  objective engagement, and probe nonlinearity.

A null from small runs does not prove incidental detection is impossible; it shows
it does not happen *for free* under natural self-supervised objectives, and that
inducing it (if possible) requires something more deliberate.

---

## 6. Status against the hypotheses

- **H1 (detectability).** Supported at the substrate level: L1 and L2 are both
  detectable by a privileged discriminator, with calibrated difficulty and a
  validated leakage gate (Experiment A).
- **H4 (legibility / incidental encoding).** Not supported under the conditions
  tested. Reframed as a conditional question rather than abandoned.
- **H2 (substrate-grounding via ablations)** and **H3 (emergence under
  selection)**: not yet tested.

---

## 7. Next steps (prioritized by likelihood of changing the result)

1. **Survival reward coupled to the dynamics.** *Attempted — see §9 (Experiment
   B-v2).* Coupling the readout to survival did **not** lift incidental encoding
   above the pre-registered threshold; the detectability-vs-encoding gap persists.
   If staying alive requires exploiting drag (e.g., locomotion cost depends on it),
   representing it becomes *instrumentally necessary*, the real Dreamer-style version
   of the claim. The probe harness accepted the actor-critic unchanged.
2. **Strengthen the multi-step objective further.** The open-loop objective was
   confirmed to engage yet still did not induce encoding (§3.4); remaining variants
   worth trying are weighting the dynamics-relevant observation dimensions and
   increasing capacity.
3. **A more encodable artifact.** L1 (input quantization) would almost certainly
   be encoded, but invites the "it is just reading input format" critique, which
   is precisely why **L3 (a generative fingerprint)** is the more interesting
   target.
4. **Scale.** More episodes / seeds / epochs. (A nonlinear probe has already been
   checked (§3.4) and also finds nothing, so probe class is not the bottleneck.)

---

## 9. Experiment B-v2 — does survival pressure induce incidental encoding?

Experiment B's null was conjectured to follow from *readout, not reward*: what the
objective does not require, the agent does not represent. B-v2 tests the strongest
lever from §7.1 — it makes the agent **act to stay alive in a world whose dynamics
drift**, so coping with the drifting drag (and thus modelling it) becomes
instrumentally useful. World identity is still never in the observation or the
reward; only the probe ever sees it. Pre-registered before the run
(`docs/PREREGISTRATION.md`). Three agents share the identical recurrent trunk and the
identical readout, differing only in objective: `untrained` (mechanical floor),
`predictor` (Experiment B's next-step prediction on this trunk), and `survival`
(recurrent A2C + GAE, potential-based food shaping, harsh metabolism so a non-forager
starves in ≈ 50 steps).

**Primary readout — pooled (Experiment B frame).** Persistent world-identity
direction across independent authentic (drift 0) vs surrogate (drift d) episodes;
≈ 0.50 means no incidental encoding. Mean ± std over 3 seeds:

| agent | drift = 0.0 (control) | drift = 0.45 (test) |
|-------|----------------------|---------------------|
| untrained | 0.460 ± 0.036 | 0.444 ± 0.027 |
| predictor | 0.493 ± 0.079 | 0.485 ± 0.053 |
| **survival** | 0.514 ± 0.052 | **0.595 ± 0.014** |

(Numbers are from the corrected run — see the GAE-bug deviation in
`docs/PREREGISTRATION.md` §12. The first run was trained with a buggy advantage estimator
that affected only the survival arm; the conclusion is unchanged.)

Gates (all pre-registered): **engagement** passed in 100 % of seeds (trained true
return beats random and scripted by ≫ the 0.15 margin: ≈ −0.2 to −0.5 vs random −1.0);
**positive control** (speed probe) 0.83–0.97; **leakage audit** (reward / length /
lifetime) clean in every cell; **L0 equivalence** for the survival agent — point
estimate 0.514 now sits comfortably inside the ±0.05 band, though TOST is still not
significant at n = 3 (p = 0.22), i.e. underpowered rather than a clean pass.

**Result — the negative holds, with a small but cleaner drift-specific trace.**

- The `predictor` agent reproduces Experiment B's null *on this trunk* (flat at
  ≈ 0.49, |dev| ≈ 0.01) — an internal validation that the apparatus and the trunk
  carry no spurious signal.
- The `survival` agent now starts **at chance** at drift 0 (0.514, |dev| ≈ 0.01 —
  the buggy run's ≈ 0.04 offset was a training artifact) and rises to **0.595 ± 0.014
  at drift 0.45**: the steepest drift slope of the three, clearly above both the
  `predictor` (0.485) and `untrained` (0.444) agents, with tight error bars. So unlike
  the prediction-only agent, survival pressure does leave a *small, drift-specific*
  trace. **But it falls far short of the pre-registered SESOI of 0.65** (an oracle reads
  the same artifact at ≈ 0.99).
- **Verdict (pre-registered decision matrix): the strong hypothesis is not
  supported.** *Detectability ≫ incidental encoding* survives the move to survival
  pressure: an agent whose life depends on the drifting dynamics gains only a faint
  statistical trace of its world's nature (≈ 0.60), not a decodable representation of
  *which world it is in*. The trace is now cleaner than the buggy run (a real
  drift-driven slope off a chance baseline, not a constant offset) and motivates a
  higher-powered follow-up rather than supporting a positive claim.

**Caveats.** n = 3 seeds (the TOST is underpowered); a single architecture, world
family, and L2 only; 300 A2C updates (the forager is engaged but not expert); and the
*reactive-vs-representational* ambiguity is unresolved — the agent may exploit *felt*
drag reactively without classifying the world. A common-garden / held-out
fixed-dynamics probe and higher power (more seeds, longer training, L3) are the
natural follow-ups. The secondary matched-pair readout is reported in
`expB2_results.json` but is demoted: with bit-identical L0 branches its
cross-validated AUROC is a biased estimate of chance, so it indexes *detectability*,
not persistent encoding.
