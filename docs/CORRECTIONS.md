# Corrections and provenance record

Dated entries, newest last. Each entry says what was wrong, which results it touches, what
was changed, and what the change does not establish. The plan these belong to is
`docs/REVISION_2026-10.md`; which implementation produced each committed number is
`docs/RESULTS_MANIFEST.md`.

Earlier corrections are recorded where they were made and are not repeated here: the GAE
padding fix (`679fee6`, `docs/PREREGISTRATION.md` 2026-06-28), the L3 world-params bug
(`docs/PREREGISTRATION_L3.md` 2026-07-10), the Experiment C estimator invalidation
(`docs/FINDINGS.md` 13.C), the matched-pair fold-safety fix (`docs/PREREGISTRATION_L3.md`
2026-07-22), and the explicit fold partition (`docs/FINDINGS.md` methods note 8 and section 16).

## 2026-10-06: results manifest

**What.** No single record said which code, configuration, seeds, fold partition, and device
produced each committed number, so a corrected result could not be told apart from a historical
one by reading the artifacts.

**Change.** `scripts/build_results_manifest.py` assigns every file under `artifacts/` to exactly
one run and records the run's commit, configuration, agent seeds, surrogate seed and capacity,
training budget, evaluation seed bases, fold partition, device, and dependency versions where
those were recorded. `--check` fails when a committed artifact belongs to no run or the
generated pages are stale. Every existing row is marked `historical`.

**Found while building it.** All survival-trained runs from `679fee6` (2026-06-28) to `4b6e1f3`
used the same `compute_gae` bootstrap, the one corrected in the next entry. The predictor arms,
the untrained arms, Experiment A, Experiment B, and Experiment C train no actor-critic and are
unaffected by it. Every readout-only analysis (H2, cross-recipe, sensory echo, observation
localization) reads saved survival agents and inherits the issue. Evaluation worlds are fixed
seed bases shared by every agent seed, and the pooled readout draws its authentic pool
(seed base 800000) and its surrogate pool (850000) from different world samples; both facts
bear on step 5 and step 13.
